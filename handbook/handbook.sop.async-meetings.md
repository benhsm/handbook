## Summary

At Dendron, we try to be async first. Async meetings let us collaborate across different timezones without being present at the same time. 
The purpose of these should be to encourage discussion, brainstorming, or decision making.

## Steps

1. Create an async. Its helpful to format it inside of Dendron by creating it as a child of your daily journal
  - eg: [[Async Metrics Updates|dendron://private/user.kevin.journal.2022.04.12.m.async-metrics-updates]]
1. Use the following format when creating the async
  ```
  @{YOUR_ALIAS}: {TITLE}
    {UPDATES}
  ```
  - optional but helpful: including a diff of thigns that changed
    - eg: [[Async Metrics Updates|dendron://private/user.kevin.journal.2022.04.12.m.async-metrics-updates]]
1. Announce async by following [[Daily Asyncs SOP|dendron://dendron.handbook/area.team.sop.daily-asyncs]]

## Reference

### Individual async meetings
Recommended and optional async meetings for yourself. Any subset of the following may work for you:
- [Daily] Journal update
- [Daily] Morning planning
- [Daily] Evening review/next day journal creation.
- [Weekly] Review tasks assigned to you in Github so they're up to date.
