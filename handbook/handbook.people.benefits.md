## Perks

- we are an open source company, you get credit for your work
  - [[Working in the Open|handbook.company.values#working-in-the-open]] is one of our key principals which means that you get to reference the full details of your work anywhere you go
- we are a remote first company which means you get to work where ever you can find an internet connection
  - we focus on [[written|handbook.company.values#documentation-first]] async communication to make this work - you'll probably have around 2h of synchronous meetings in any given week
- we believe in being generous with equity and have a seven year excise window instead of the industry standard 90 days
