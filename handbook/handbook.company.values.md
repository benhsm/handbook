## Summary

Our values reflect what we believe in and inform how we make decisions. 

## Learn and Adapt

Dendron [[helps humans build upon the knowledge of the ages|handbook.company.mission]]. This means learning from past mistakes and building on top of what has come before.

We take best practices from the places we admire and adapt them for current realities. When implementing new functionality, instead of *not invented here*, we look to  *build on what already exists*.

This is not a one-off process but something that we work at each and every day.

## 80/20

In many situations, 20% of the work accounts for 80% of the output.  This is also known as the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). 

This could be finding a *good enough solution* for an intractable problem or refining a document down to just the key points - we focus on doing work that has the highest impact.

## Iterate

The perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be _perfect_. We prioritize ruthlessly, delivering the right things with the right quality in a timely fashion.

Iteration means that we will hit the deadline but are flexible about the scope. It's okay and also encouraged to have multiple phases for any individual feature.

<!-- ### In Practice

- We publish our work (eg. code, handbook, roadmap) in the process of working on it
- We push out updates on a [weekly release cycle](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html) -->

## Close the Loop

Whether we are working on features or improving processes, the job isn't done until value has been delivered. 

That means just shipping the feature isn't enough - our users need to be able to adapt and get value from the feature in their daily workflow. 

## Community Focus

Dendron wouldn't exist without our strong community. Our north star is meaningfully improving the lives of everyone who uses Dendron. 

This means listening closely to what our users have to say, making sure everyone can have a voice, and making decisions based on whether it will be beneficial for our users.

When defining community, this means **both** our direct users as well as people on the Dendron team. 

## Pass it Forward

We aim to leave things in a better state than when we found it. Whether that's code, documentation, best practices, or personal development, we strive to continuously improve the things that we see.

This means creating [[standard operating procedures|handbook.sop]] to spread best practices, documenting things so that others can find them, and continuously driving change to make existing things better. 

This also means working in the open so that everyone can benefit from our learnings - Dendron is built on the work that has come before us and we like to make it possible for others to build upon the work that we do. 


## Keep no False Idols

The only constant in the universe is change. As we establish best practices and ways of doing it, we need to remember that things change and what might have worked yesterday might no longer be relevant today.

This means that while we have ways of doing things, those ways can change and *because we've always done it this way* is never a good justification for not considering changing. 



<!-- ### In Practice

- We provide personal onboardings for new users
- We addressing questions and feedback in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) in near realtime
- We adjusting and prioritize user feedback when planning our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html)
- We err on the side of over communicating when we're not sure if our message is understood -->

<!-- - We dedicate a `learnings` section to the end of every project to figure out how to improve the process for next time -->

<!-- ## Sustainability

We look for virtuous cycles and long term growth in what we do. This means we think about the long term **costs and benefits** of what we do, features we ship, and promises that we make.

Whether its code, tooling our community - our goal is to leave things in a better state than how we found it.  -->


<!-- ### Key Principles

#### Pragmatism

We have high level goals but we are flexible in the details. At the end of the day we will do whatever it takes to help people make sense of the things that matter.  We look to integrate with existing tools instead of replacing them using pods and interoperable standards

## Bias for Action

> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

> Amazon Leadership Principle


## Working in the Open

This means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things. 

### In Practice

- We released Dendron as an open source product
- We published our handbook for everyone to see
- We publish our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html) on github


### In Practice
- All important decisions and learnings are written down in the company handbook so everyone can benefit
- We are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)
- We would rather scope down or postpone work than do work that is unsustainable (eg. extended long hours, significant tech debt or operational cost, etc)

### Key Principles

#### Systems First

While we generally trust that people will try to do the right thing, humans make mistakes. Its part of being human. Therefore, we aim to build automated processes and systems for common and complicated issues. 

In Practice:
- Continuous Integration tests on all features
- Checklists and SOPs for all processes

#### Flywheels

We are looking to create systems that make make things easier

In Practice:
- [[Learn and Adapt|handbook.company.values#learn-and-adapt]] -> [[Iterate|handbook.company.values#iteration]] -> [[Learn|handbook.company.values#lifelong-learning]]

#### Bias for Simplicity

Things should be as complicated as they need to be and no more. 

In Practice:
- When creating new features, opt for sensible defaults vs need for extra configuration

#### Pruning

Complexity happens when growth happens in absence of feedback. Pruning is about inventing and simplifying.  Whether its working on Dendron, internal processes or external documentation, the goal is not to simply add more features and functions but also consider how things are like as a whole

In Practice:
- Dedicated [pruning](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3be48b69-76e1-495e-9314-cae2fe22813d.html#pruning-Ô∏è) section in changelog
- Monthly review of internal processes and external docs for pruning opportunities


<!-- ## Passing It Forward

We leave things better than we found it. Code, knowledge, the world - we like to leave things so that the next person coming back do it will have a better way of starting.

### In Practice
- all important decisions and learnings are written down in the company handbook so everyone can benefit
- we are collecting and indexing the worlds data in publically available vaults on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) and of course [XKCD](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)
