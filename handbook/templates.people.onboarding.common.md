### Daily Journal Note
This is how we do standups at Dendron

- [ ] Read over the sop (standard operating procedure) on [[handbook.sop.daily-journal]]
- [ ] Open your daily journal note for today. It should be in the format of `user.{{ALIAS}}.{{date}}`. Your manager should have created this one for you. You're responsible for maintaining your own journals for future dates. You can read more about the format [[here|schemas.user#dailyjournal]] 
   - NOTE: to create a daily journal, we recommend [[pinning|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.guides.tips#pinning-tabs]] your current daily journal and then using lookup to update the day component at the end of the day to create the daily journal for the next day

- [ ] Make sure your Discord profile has a **photo** - it makes it easier for other team members to remember you!

   1. We love to hear more, such as where you were before, family/pets, and hobbies.
   1. We also enjoy pictures if you're willing to share. Consider giving your new team members a glimpse into your world (scroll through previous messages in the channel for inspiration).
