## Summary
How to pair using microsoft live share

## Prerequisites
Follow instructions in [Use Microsoft Live Share to collaborate with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share) 

You'll also probably want to allow your partner to run tasks and control the
debugging session. These are configured under the extension settings. When
debugging the extension, only the host can see the user interface so the host
should share their screen.

## Steps
1. When pairing begins, the driver will start a collaboration session and send their partner the code
2. The partner should join the session from their VSCode and not the browser for the best experience
