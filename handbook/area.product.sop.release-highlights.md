## Summary
<!-- What is this SOP about -->
This goes over writing release highlights.

## Details

The first sections of any release notes will contain an overview highlighting specific features and enhancements of a release.

This is made up of:

- Overview of features, enhancements, and/or breaking changes of importance in the release.
- `## Highlights`: Changelog items referenced in the overview.
- `## Everything Else`: Changelog items not referenced in the overview.

### Style

```markdown
Dendron <version> has sprouted ðŸŒ±

**Highlight type:** Description here.

- More information: [[Title of Docs and Header if Used|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/example.docs]]

**Highlight type:** Description here.

- More information: [Title of Docs and Header if Used](https://docs.dendron.so/)
```

- **Bold** is used to help signify that a different feature/enhancement/breaking/etc. changes.
- Bullet points help break up the highlights.
- If the docs exist outside of `dendron.dendron-site`, then make sure to provide an external link instead (`[label](link target)`). Otherwise, these links will appear as private/broken in the published documentation.
- Add associated changelog items to the `## Highlights` section, and remaining changelog items to `## Everything Else`. Make sure to remove all PR and contributor references. Remove docs links if they are being provided in the highlights overview already.

### Example

Example from [[0.87 Release|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/changelog.release.2022-03-22]]:

```markdown
Dendron 0.87 has sprouted  ðŸŒ±

**Breaking changes:** We updated the airtableId format to be a dictionary instead of a single value. This makes it possible to export a single note to multiple tables.

If you are using v2 of the airtable pod, you can migrate to the new version by following the [[instructions here|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.pod-v2.ref.builtin.airtable.migration#migrating-to-0870]].

- More information in the [RFC on standardizing source-field mapping for Pods](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/N0G4s23hFDGVnsjHhh6dt.html)

**Self Contained Vaults:** We are now in early preview of self contained vaults. This lets you use and share your Dendron vaults without the need of a workspace.

If you are interested in trying this out, please fill out this [survey](https://airtable.com/shr0cwk0a9tujeipZ) and we'll add you to early-preview where we'll be holding discussions and offering support. We'll also send you specialized instructions for how to set up self contained vaults!

- More information in [in our RFC about self contained vaults](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/aOOBYTowLEKJDEtLWFiHb/)

**Speed Improvements:** `Dendron: Show Preview` refreshes faster and editing larger workspaces is more responsive.

This release also includes a number of fixes and improvements, including a new command to aid in creating and reading backup files.

- More information [[in our documentation on open backup|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.commands#open-backup]].
