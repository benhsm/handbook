### Prefer native links

If linking to content inside a Dendron workspace, always use wikilinks (vs raw urls). 

- Why: Using wikilinks lets us refactor, see backlinks, and use all of Dendron's functionality

### A Loom is worth a thousand words

When describing a longer process, aim to use a loom video instead

- Why: easier to follow along

### Put images under the asset hierarchy

If you have images you would like to embed, prefer to add them to the [[Asset|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/asset]] hiearchy.
