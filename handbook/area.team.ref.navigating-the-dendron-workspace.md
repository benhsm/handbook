## Summary
How to navigate the Dendron workspace

## Context
The Dendron workspace is immense and contains over 10k notes (and growing). This reference is a guide on how things are organized

## Start Here

There are a few primary hiearchies in the Dendron workspace:

### For looking things up
- [[Areas|dendron://dendron.handbook/area]]: Primary entry point to different aspects about Dendron (eg. product, team, community, metrics, etc)
- [[Services|dendron://dendron.handbook/s]]: This goes over all services used by Dendron
    - [[ext]]: these are specific bookmarks to external resources. It's related to the service hierarchy. You can think of them as bookmarks that can be managed inside Dendron

### For team use
- [[Weekly|dendron://dendron.handbook/weekly]]: Sprint planning

### For personal use
- [[User|dendron://dendron.handbook/user]]: The user hierarchy is how individual team members record what they are working on

## Common Children

In all hiearchies, you'll see the following child notes. 

### quickstart

A short guide that goes over 80/20 capabilities of a service

### concepts

Concepts are like a glossary of hierarchy specific terms

### ref
- fullName: reference

A reference note can hang of anything. It is used to create a light-weight grouping of related information

- Examples
    - [[s.airtable.ref.base]]: grouping of bases in airtable 
    - [[Product Scopes|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.scopes]]: grouping of dendron product scopes

### topic

A topic is a **sufficiently large or complex area** of a particular hierarchy.  As a rule of thumb, something might be a topic if it requires its own `quickstart`, `concepts` and `ref` notes
