#stage.germ

## Context
The Dendron workspace is immense and contains over 10k notes (and growing). It can be overwhelming. This reference is a guide on how things are organized

## Start Here

There are a few primary hiearchies in the Dendron workspace:

### For looking things up
- [[Areas|dendron://dendron.handbook/area]]: Primary entry point to different aspects about Dendron (eg. product, team, community, metrics, etc)
- [[Services|dendron://dendron.handbook/s]]: This goes over all services used by Dendron

### For team use
- [[Weekly|dendron://dendron.handbook/weekly]]: Sprint planning

### For personal use
- [[User|dendron://dendron.handbook/user]]: The user hierarchy is how individual team members record what they are working on
