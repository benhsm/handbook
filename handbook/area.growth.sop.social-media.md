### Weekly

Visit the following for latest comments or questions. These have less activity, which is why they are weekly checks. Generally, these should be checked more often if we've recently shared or uploaded something new, which is when we get the most activity (latest YouTube video, latest blog posts, etc.).

### Blog posts and cross-posting

Whenever a new post is added to the [Dendron Blog](https://blog.dendron.so/), we need to make announcements and cross-post to other websites that are configured to use `canonicalUrl` references.
