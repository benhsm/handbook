## Summary

Daily Asyncs are where all asyncs are posted. Think of it as a company wide [bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)) for information. 

## Context

Its easy to lose messages in discord, especially announcements. Daily asyncs this gives us one source of truth for all team wide announcements

## Steps

### Creating
1. After you have created your [[Async Meetings|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.sop.async-meetings]], paste it into the [[Daily Async GDoc|dendron://private/ext.gdoc.main.daily-async]] for today's date
  - If no date exists for today, create one
  - If date exists, add your async to the **top of the list**
    - *It is easy to look at the first item under the day and think there are no outstanding asyncs that need your acknowledgement. For this reason, adding a new async to the bottom makes it easy to be missed*
  - cutoff time for a given date is 23:59PM UTC of the same day

### Responding
1. Dendron team members should [[add an acknowledgement|dendron://private/area.team.sop.weekly-planning-commenting#adding-an-acknowledgement]] for all previous day asyncs within 24h of the day

### Archiving
1. The daily meeting notes for a given day will be imported into the `meet.daily.{date}` hierarchy every week on Wednesday. 
    - NOTE: on Thursday, notes from previous Wednesday to this week Tuesday midnight will be imported and then erased from the google doc
