## Summary

## Prerequisites

## Day Two

### Setup Google Calendar
- [ ] Set your Google Calendar [default event duration](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings) to use `speedy meetings`
- [ ] [Set your working hours & availability](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) in your Google Calendar.

### Setup Calendly
- [ ] Set up [Calendly](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#sts=Calendly). Calendly is a calendar tool that allows individuals to select open meeting slots in order to speak with others outside of Dendron. For Dendron team members, feel free to schedule directly through Google calendar. When you are setting up Calendly, there is no specific Dendron account. With the free version you will only be allowed one meeting time, but if you need to upgrade to a Pro account, you can do so and expense it.
- [ ] Add the Zoom integration by going to the `Integrations` section at the top of the page. Find Zoom in the list of integrations and click it. It will then ask you to link your Calendly and Zoom accounts together. Do so.
- [ ] Now make Zoom the default event location by editing each 'Event type' in Calendly (By default, there should be a `15 Minute Meeting`, `30 Minute Meeting` and `60 Minute Meeting` event types) by clicking the gear icon associated with each event type then going to `Edit`. Click on `What event is this?` and under `Location` choose Zoom. Click on `Save and Close`, and do this for each remaining event type.
- [ ] add your calendly links to `user.{{username}}.ref.cal` (see [[Cal|dendron://private/user.kevin.ref.cal]] for an example)

## Day Three
- [ ] Connect with or follow Dendron's social media sites:
      [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dendron-so/),
      [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dendronhq),
      [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GQLj4KZhN8WcJPiKXtcRQ).
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our [[expense report process|dendron.sop.expensing]] and bookmark the [link](https://airtable.com/shrtJd0sitnY6Bfre) to expensing stuff.

## Day Four
- [ ] Set a reminder for 14 days past your start date to complete the [Onboarding Survey](https://airtable.com/shrcILcL6cm6lpCZt). We're actively trying to improve this process so please be proactive in reporting issues (or fixing them).
