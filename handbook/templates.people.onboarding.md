## Welcome to Dendron!

We are so excited youâ€™re here and look forward to setting you up for remote-first success as your journey begins. You can work through the tasks over the course of your first 30 days. If any task doesn't make sense, please reach out to the team on discord in `#dendron-team`. 

- **Note:** We're really appreciative of Gitlab pioneering the space of remote work and have included a lot of links to the Gitlab handbook. The wealth of information in this note can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to skim through resources, bookmark them and come back at a later time.

## Introduction

This is your core onboarding to work at Dendron. It has been crafted with the [three dimensions of remote onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/) in mind, namely: Organizational Onboarding, Technical Onboarding and Social Onboarding.

## Support and our Single Source of Truth

Since Dendron aspires to be a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available in the [handbook](http://handbook.dendron.so). If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please reach out on the `#dendron-team` channel in Discord and update the handbook once you find the answer.

## The First Thirty Days

This note consists of a series of tasks which should be completed sequentially over the course of the next thirty days structured as follows:

| Day        | Area of Focus                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 01** | Intro, Accounts, Paperwork, First Task       |
| **Day 02** | Remote Work: Communication and Values        |
| **Day 03** | Organizational Structure and Social Elements |
| **Day 04** | Introduction to Dendron and using Github     |


Though you may be eager to jump right into your role we encourage you to set aside dedicated time every day for your first week to focus on these tasks as they are geared toward ensuring you are enabled to [thrive in an all-remote environment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/#the-importance-of-onboarding).

## Continuous Improvement

In the interests of [[passing it forward|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.company.values#pass-it-forward]], we encourage you to suggest changes and updates to this note and the handbook, both of which can be done via Pull Request (PR).

Along with this you will complete onboarding on Day Thirty by being asked to fill out the [Onboarding Satisfaction Survey](https://airtable.com/shrcILcL6cm6lpCZt), which is an opportunity to share feedback on your general Onboarding Experience.

## Day 1 - Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork

- NOTE1: the best way to follow along in this onboarding is by using the preview. You can run `Dendron: Show Preview` by selecting it from the [command prompt](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/rLlUBUvNmv5gu9YmZfUJE.html).
- NOTE2: relative links currently don't work in the preview (this is currently being addressed). To navigate links, hover over a link in the editor and use `CTRL+Enter` to navigate

### Calendar
<!--Trial/Part-time optional-->

#### Set Up

- [ ] Set your Google Calendar [default event duration](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings) to use `speedy meetings`
- [ ] Set up [Calendly](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#sts=Calendly). Calendly is a calendar tool that allows individuals to select open meeting slots in order to speak with others outside of Dendron. For Dendron team members, feel free to schedule directly through Google calendar. When you are setting up Calendly, there is no specific Dendron account. With the free version you will only be allowed one meeting time, but if you need to upgrade to a Pro account, you can do so and expense it.
- [ ] Add the Zoom integration by going to the `Integrations` section at the top of the page. Find Zoom in the list of integrations and click it. It will then ask you to link your Calendly and Zoom accounts together. Do so.
- [ ] Now make Zoom the default event location by editing each 'Event type' in Calendly (By default, there should be a `15 Minute Meeting`, `30 Minute Meeting` and `60 Minute Meeting` event types) by clicking the gear icon associated with each event type then going to `Edit`. Click on `What event is this?` and under `Location` choose Zoom. Click on `Save and Close`, and do this for each remaining event type.

   - [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues) - Issues related to
     our main tool.
   - [Dendron Site](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/issues) - Issues related to documentation.
