## Summary
<!-- What is this SOP about -->
How we give feedback at Dendron

## Prerequisites
1. Have access to the `admin` vault 

## Steps
1. For each direct report, create `[[user.{{name}}.{{feedback}}]]` note inside the `admin` vault 
  - use this space to make notes for direct reports, noting areas of strength and areas for focus
1. When writing feedback
    - Evaluate performance based on company values [^1], key principles [^2], and role specific competencies
    - For feedback, focus on strengths and specific instances of when a strength has been demonstrated
    - For improvements, focus on areas that are in conflict with company values[^1] and key principles [^2]
    - In general, we bias for grow a person's strengths vs making up for a particular weakness
