## Summary

The backlog journal is where we track items that fall outside of scope for the day or the week

## Steps

Backlog items are tracked in `user.{name}.backlog`.

If you find items being carried over week after week in your [[weekly Journal|handbook.sop.weekly-journal]], consider moving it to the backlog. 

This is also a good place to queue up upcoming projects that you'll be working on this month/quarter.

## Checklist

## Template
![[dendron://dendron.handbook/templates.backlog]]

### Sections

#### Next

This is for items that should be done in the next week

#### Later

This is for items that should be done further out then a week from now. Later in turn is sorted by tasks that are due 1, 2, or 3 months from now. There shouldn't be any project that is further out than 3 months. That belongs in the team backlog.

```markdown
## Later

### 1 months

### 3 months
