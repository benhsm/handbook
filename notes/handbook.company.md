## Summary

Dendron is building the future of knowledge management, starting within the IDE.

The big problem with knowledge management is that there's too much of it and no good way of finding it when you need it. Google organizes the world's information to make it accessible, but there's nothing that does that for personal or institutional information. If search worked in this case, google drive and google docs should be enough for note taking (but they're not). 

We already have a way of managing information at scale. Big software projects are millions of lines of code, but developers are able to work through that complexity with IDEs (integrated development environments) that let them uniformly structure, update, and find specific areas of code. Dendron is taking those same concepts and applying it to general knowledge - we make it possible to enforce a consistent structure across thousands of documents so that you can always find what you need.
