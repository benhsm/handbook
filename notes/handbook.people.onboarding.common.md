## Standup

- instead of standup, we do daily journals
- you can see an example of a daily journal [[here|user.kevin.journal.2021.05.31]] (you'll need to be in a dendron workspace to see this)
- use the following [[template|templates.standup]] to create your own daily journal
  - you can create a more specific template for your needs at `templates.standup.{username}`
- have your standup updates ready in `user.{username}.journal.{date}`
- standup notes should be in before 8AM pacific time or 5pm of your local time of the current day (whichever comes first)
