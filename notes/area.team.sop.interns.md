## Intern Projects
Scope out intern projects at the beginning of the internship. It should be something self contained that can be delivered over the course of three months. Time wise - plan for the core part of the project taking 6 weeks (2 weeks buffer). The last 4 weeks can be used on stretch goals.

Separate from the main project, try to find a deliverable that is related to the main project that can be shipped within the first two weeks of the intern starting. This will help give them an early win and set them up for taking on their main project. 

## One on One
As an intern mentor, make some time to check in with your intern. 
For the first month, have a one on one every week at a set time. 
The format should be similar to [[One on One|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.sop.one-on-one]]

After the first month, you and your intern can decide whether to continue weekly or to switch to once every two weeks.

### First Meeting
During the first meeting, walk the intern through their intern project as well as their first deliverable.
