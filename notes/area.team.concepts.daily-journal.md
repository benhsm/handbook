## Summary

The daily journal is a core part of how we work at Dendron. Every team member has a daily journal note located at `user.{username}.journal.{date}` which captures what we're working on for the day. 

## Context

Daily journals let us keep everyone up to date without generating unecessary noise.  The information for what everyone is working on is systematically structured for every individual, free for anyone to check up or check in with. 

The [[Discussion|dendron://dendron.handbook/templates.standup.details#discussion]] section lets team members raise blockers or issues that won't get lost in a chat session. Managers (or team mates) can then respond, usually in an discord thread which the whole team can chime in on (if needed).
