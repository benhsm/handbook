## Goals
These are the 2-3 big items that you want to accomplish this week

## Wins
See [[Wins|templates.weekly-planning.gdoc#wins]]

## Learnings
See [[Learnings|templates.weekly-planning.gdoc#learnings]]

## Ongoing Projects 
Every team member is responsible for one or more projects that will span multiple weeks. Keep track of those projects (in order of priority) here so it's always top of mind.

## Assigned
Things you want to get to during the week. Items that you aren't ready to work on can be put here

## Blocked
These are items that you are currently blocked on. If an item from a daily journal is pending external action and not resolved at the end of the day, it is good to move here.

## Weekly recurring
Recurring tasks you *must do* on a certain day go here. Consider replacing with a recurring invite calendar if that's more your style, though it's a nice feeling to be able to check things off during the week.

## Next

Things to bring up for weekly planning session. 
This can be new ideas or the second phase of current tasks.
