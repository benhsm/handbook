## Summary 

One on one's are a chance to reflect on what's been done, go over blockers, and plan for the future. It is also a chance to talk about career goals and growth plans at Dendron.

The cadence for one on one's will depend on the individual and circumstance - in general, we'll do this 1x per week for the first month and then at a relaxed cadence afterwards.
