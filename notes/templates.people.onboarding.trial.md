We are so excited youâ€™re here and building with us ðŸŒ±

Before you begin, please go through the [[Start Here|dendron://dendron.handbook/area.team.t.basics#start-here]] section in the handbook (the other sections you can finish in your own time when relevant)

## Initial Tasks
- [ ] Create and add your own [[user readme|templates.user-readme]]. This goes in `user.{{ALIAS}}` 
   - NOTE: this may take some time to create so please feel free to iterate on it over the course of the week
- [ ] Create a `user.{{ALIAS}}.friction` note  - use this to record any points of friction you encounter with Dendron during your first two weeks

## Other Tasks
- For engineers, see [[dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.people.onboarding.engineering]]
