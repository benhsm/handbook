## Summary
- stage: Seed
<!-- What is this SOP about -->
A CoE is a **Correction of Errors** that we conduct after a mistake has been identified. 

CoE's serve two primary functions:
1. To recognize that a mistake in an organization rarely is the fault of an individual but rather something systematic that needs to be addressed in a similar function
2. To understand what happened in this incident and make sure we don't repeat the same mistakes again

## Steps
1. Use the [[Coe|dendron://dendron.handbook/template.coe]] template and create a new entry in `coe.{date}.{incident-title}`
1. When the CoE is ready for review, add it to the discussion item for the next [[Weekly Planning|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.sop.weekly-planning]]
