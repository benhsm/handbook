## Summary

Our hiring process changes depending on your history with Dendron. It consists of three phases:
- interview with the founder
- interview with the team
- 2 week contracting gig

If you've been a regular contributor to one of our open source projects  and have done at least few [medium](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1e6c8b49-ef88-4e79-b2df-e9d614c38a53.html#medium) tasks, often we will skip the contracting part and hire you after the round of interviews. 

Otherwise, we'll do a paid two week contracting gig where you will be doing the same job as what you would when working with us full time. We find this is a much better way of evaluating fit than a coding screen and gives both us and you a chance to make sure we work well together.
