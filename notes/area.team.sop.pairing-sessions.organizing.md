Pairings are setup based on the following heuristics:
- teaching (pair more experienced dev with less experienced)
- context (pair people who are working on similar or overlapping things)
- socialization (pair people who have not had a chance to work together)

All past pairing assignments are found here: [[Pairing|dendron://private/ext.gsheet.team.pairing]]
