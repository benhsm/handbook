## Summary
<!-- What is this SOP about -->

The [[Dendron Reading Series|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.reading-series]] is done once a week at every release.

## Prerequisites

- Visit [reading series submissions on Airtable](https://airtable.com/appv7r4uhFzqTvj5m/tbl9oZ3f3910235Rp/viw7a0MFendhdXcf1?blocks=bipXOxR92mxbuEA6v) to see if there are any submissions that haven't yet been published
  - If so, select one that can be used for publication
  - For users that have a submission accepted for publication, make sure their `[[people.*]]` profile lists that they have the `#role.scout` role in the body, and give them the [[Scout role|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.discord.roles#scout]] in Discord
    - Follow [[Add Discord Role|dendron://private/dendron.sop.add-discord-role]] for reference example

## Steps

1. Create a new entry in `community.events.reading-series.{journal}` with the date aligning to a release date
  - eg: `dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.reading-series.2022.03.01`
1. Provide a link, and up to a few paragraphs on what you thought about it.
    - Review/revise the reading series submission, as needed, when formatting and prepping for publishing
    - If no submission is available in Airtable, create your own
    - see an example here: [[22 - Spaced repetition: a hack to make your brain store information|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.reading-series.2022.03.01]]
    - Note: Update the title to increment the number of the series
    - Make sure to use `>-` yaml formatting with strings
1. Add a note reference in the weekly release notes
    - eg: [[Dendron Reading Series|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/changelog.release.2022-03-01#dendron-reading-series]]
1. Pin in on the #teatime channel using the reading series template[^1] ^IeMaLaK5zDKq

## Tweet
- when: do this 1 day after the reading series has been released

1. On twitter, tweet about the reading series
1. Divide up the comments. Make sure the link to the reading series shows up in the first tweet
  - NOTE: you might have to editorialize the reading series to make this work
  - eg: https://twitter.com/dendronhq/status/1529497364460752896
1. Is applicable, tag the original author/publisher/users mentioned as part of the tweet
1. Remove any first person references from the post. If a paragraph exceeds the word count, editorialize/trim it
