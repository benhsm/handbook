## Summary

Every in Dendron has their own user hiearchy. We use it for standups, tracking backlogs, as an about page and more. 

## Key Nodes

Used for standups. You will be creating a daily journal for each working day. 
- NOTE: for part-time team members, there might be days when you will be taking on less work or nothing at all. We still ask that you create a daily journal for the day to help us keep track of progress
